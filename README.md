About Advent of Code
--------------------

[Advent of Code][aoc-about] is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles
for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any
programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st
to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after
solving the first). Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl][aoc-eric], and is
100% free. If you want to hang out with other fellow coders, discuss about puzzles
and solutions, or just have a look around, you can join the official subreddit: 
[r/adventofcode][aoc-reddit], or the unofficial IRC channel: `#adventofcode` on 
`irc.libera.chat`.


About this repo
---------------
In this repository you can find my solutions and walkthroughs for the puzzles as
well as other miscellaneus things like visualizations and other scripts.

In each year's folder you will find:

- `README.md`: an overview of that year's problems with links to my solutions 
   to them.
- `day-xx`: my solutions for the puzzles organized by day.
  - `README.md`: the problem and solution w/ outputs along w/ instructions for
     runnning the program.
  - `solution.py`: Part 1 and 2 of each problem as a single file.
- `day-xx/input`: a directory to store any problem inputs.
- `day-xx/misc`: any extra files created in the solution or as extra. This
   could be visualizations, images, tests, etc.
- `lib/`: small library of utilities written for that specific year. As there are
   reoccuring problems and concepts, this folder will hold common code used by 
   multiple solutions.
